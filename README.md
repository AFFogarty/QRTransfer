# QRTransfer
An Android app for transferring files via QR codes.

We made this over 24 hours at a hackathon. Amazingly, it works. Don't try doing this: QR codes can barely represent 1KB each, and without any networking, you're left displaying them very slowly in order to give the reader phone time to detect and scan them.

Still, it works, and we can move just under 10KB/Minute.
